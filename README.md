### Business Model
 - OS-Climate Business Model: non-profit 501(c)(6) business association under the Linux Foundation (largest organizer of open-source tech initiatives globally); platform management and development funded by annual member fees plus philanthropic grants.
 - Why Open Source? To overcome data & analytics barriers which block investments needed to meet Paris Climate Accord goals, we apply the community-based open-source approach that enabled major breakthroughs in Life Sciences & Tech (Human Genome Project, COVID Vaccines, Hyperledger, Linux OS).  Please see https://os-climate.org/about-open-source/

### Join an OS-Climate Group List
You can now subscribe to OS-Climate group lists and receive the latest information on our various workstreams, including new data sources/datasets, software development activity, tool/model enhancements, weekly meeting invites, and summary notes.  The group lists also provide a vehicle for product, tech, and process discussions between members.  We encourage everyone to use these group lists when communicating, so we create a consistent, inclusive, and reliable method to engage members based on their area of focus and/or interest.

These are OS-Climate's group lists, along with a brief description:
