## OS-Climate's Business Model

- OS-Climate Business Model: non-profit 501(c)(6) business association under the Linux Foundation (largest organizer of open-source tech initiatives globally); platform management and development funded by annual member fees plus philanthropic grants.
- Why Open Source? To overcome data & analytics barriers which block investments needed to meet Paris Climate Accord goals, we apply the community-based open-source approach that enabled major breakthroughs in Life Sciences & Tech (Human Genome Project, COVID Vaccines, Hyperledger, Linux OS). Please see <https://os-climate.org/about-open-source/>
