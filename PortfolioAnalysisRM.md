  - The path to developing a transparent, robust, and decision-useful model
  - OS-Climate shares:

    - How it is measuring the alignment in line with long-term climate goals
    - Challenges around Scope 3 emission data
    - Learnings in generating credible temperature alignment results
    - Future plans and its way forward

  - Summary
    - Real decarbonization requires that cumulative emissions stay within a defined carbon budget
    - Integrating all carbon emission scopes of a company without a clear understanding of the set-up and underlying assumptions of a climate benchmark generates meaningless results
    - Estimations and uncertainty are important factors in understanding sector alignment outcomes
